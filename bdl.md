5.0 out of 5 stars profound

By A Customer on 9 Feb. 2000

A book for those who are not satisfied with watered down versions of the Buddha's teaching. Nina Van Gorkom conveys the sublime wisdom of Buddhism admirably. A book that should be read over and over. 

This is not an easy book, but books on such matters as religion can not be rated based on easiness. For readers who are interested in understanding the depth of the Buddha's Teaching, this is a very good introduction. It gives a clear summary of the main points without simplifying the vastness and complexity of the Buddha's wisdom, something that has become unfortunately a common tendency in many Buddhist books written in modern time.

## About the author

**Name:** Gorkom, Nina Van 	**Role:** Author	

**International Standard Name Identifier (ISNI):** 0000 0000 6398 0326

**Biography**

Nina van Gorkom was born in 1928 to a family of socialist intellectuals. Her father was a member of the Dutch parliament. She studied at Leyden University and during this time she became a Catholic. In 1952, she married Lodewijk van Gorkom, a Dutch diplomat.

In 1965, Lodewijk was posted to Thailand and Nina started learning the Thai language. She took a keen interest in Buddhism, attending classes for foreigners at Wat Mahathat. There she met, in the summer of 1966, Sujin Boriharnwanaket. Impressed by the profundity of the Buddhist teachings, she became convinced of the truth of the Buddha’s words and later assisted Khun Sujin in discussions about Buddhism for Thai radio stations. These talks were later published as Buddhism in Daily Life, her first book.

Nina and Lodewijk left Thailand in 1970 and lived in Japan, New York, Indonesia (where Lodewijk was the Dutch ambassador) and Austria. Lodewijk retired in 1990 and she now lives in The Hague in Holland.

Nina’s writings are well-known amongst English speaking Buddhists, and she is highly respected in Thailand where several of her books have been translated into the Thai language with (after many reprints) over one hundred thousand copies now. Her books have also been translated in Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Nepal, China, Vietnam and Germany.
