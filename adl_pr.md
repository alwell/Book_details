# Press Release Abhihamma in Daily Life

## Reality made Real


We live mostly in a changing world of ideas. We are caught up in concepts. What is real and important can be lost as we strive to compete. Abhidhamma in Daily Life goes straight to the heart of Buddhist doctrine. It defines what is real with the aim of freeing us from the daily rat race.

The purpose of the book is to give a fundamental understanding of the five senses: seeing, hearing, touching, tasting, smelling and the all important sixth sense, the mind. Only when we truly understand these six senses can we begin to comprehend what is important and truly real.

Abhidhamma in Daily Life shows us how to apply the basic precepts of Buddhist teaching in our daily life which will impact not only on ourselves, but also on those around us. It cuts through the complexities of the original text, the Pāli Tipiṭaka, simplifying the scriptures without losing their meaning. Many Pāli terms are used, but they are defined as they are introduced making it suitable for the beginner as well as practising Buddhists.

Abhidhamma in Daily Life is a vital key for unlocking the deep meaning of the Buddha's teachings and the Buddhist way of life.
