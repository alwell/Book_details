This study explains that right understanding is indispensable for mental development, the development of calm as well as the development of insight The author describes in detail all mental phenomena (citta and cetasika), and physical phenomena (rupa) and explains the processes of mental phenomena that experience objects through the sense-doors and the mind-door. The last chapters are in the form of questions and answers and deal with the problems one may face in the development of insight.

Aki Karvonen
5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent survey to Abhidhamma
11 June 2018 (Amazon.co.uk)
Format: Hardcover
In my opinion the best introduction on Theravada Abhidhamma. Clear, systematic and written in simple English. It includes just the right amount of repetition to make it easier to digest this pretty difficult part of the Pali Canon, i.e. the Abhidhamma Pitaka. Maybe Bhikkhu Bodhi's Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma and Nina Van Gorkom's Abhidhamma in Daily Life could be read first, and then this book.

**Biography**

*Sujin Boriharnwanaket*, born 1927, is a Thai Vipassana and Abhidhamma teacher. She graduate dfrom Triam Udom High School and has published numerous books and articles in Thai and English. She has also given lectures on radio throughout Thailand on a regular basis.

*Nina van Gorkom* was born in 1928 to a family of socialist intellectuals. Her father was a member of the Dutch parliament. She studied at Leyden University and during this time she became a Catholic. In 1952, she married Lodewijk van Gorkom, a Dutch diplomat.

In 1965, Lodewijk was posted to Thailand and Nina started learning the Thai language. She took a keen interest in Buddhism, attending classes for foreigners at Wat Mahathat. There she met, in the summer of 1966, Sujin Boriharnwanaket. Impressed by the profundity of the Buddhist teachings, she became convinced of the truth of the Buddha’s words and later assisted Khun Sujin in discussions about Buddhism for Thai radio stations. These talks were later published as Buddhism in Daily Life, her first book.

Nina and Lodewijk left Thailand in 1970 and lived in Japan, New York, Indonesia (where Lodewijk was the Dutch ambassador) and Austria. Lodewijk retired in 1990 and she now lives in The Hague in Holland.

Nina’s writings are well-known amongst English speaking Buddhists, and she is highly respected in Thailand where several of her books have been translated into the Thai language with (after many reprints) over one hundred thousand copies now. Her books have also been translated in Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Nepal, China, Vietnam and Germany.
