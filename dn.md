**Description** 

Dhamma Now is a collection of reflections based on discussions about the understanding of the truth as taught by the Buddha. This truth differs radically from our usual assumptions of the way things are, which can be likened to a dream world.

Quotes from the Buddhist scriptures have been added to show how these reflections relate to the original teachings of the Buddha.

This book is a shortened version of Understanding Life Now.
