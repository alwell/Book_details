**Reviews:**

ADL 5.0 out of 5 stars,concise clear and spiritually alive teaching.

As a teacher myself in England working with students aged 13-18; I found the layout of the text to be of the clearest teaching methods that the most professional of teachers would employ. More so as a teacher of Religious Studies and a practising Buddhist I thank Nina for enlarging my understanding of the Dharma through such an interesting living approach to what can easily succumb to be a dreary intellectual task.

Abhidhamma made easy. By Sarakanion 2 September 2006

This book is about Cittas or types of consciousness in a Buddhist context. Ms Van Gorkhum has also written a recent book on Cetasika's or mental factors/flavours associated with consciousness and she has also written a book that may be out soon on the Pacchayas or conditional relations.

The first book is simply brilliant. It opens up the abhidhamm in a way the Abhidhamma Sangaha cannot to a complete beginner. The Sangaha is of course a primary, vital reference - but Van Gorkhum's treatment is more like a dictionary of some of the major types of consciousness as summarised in the A. Sangaha.

I can't put the book down and read it chapter by chapter - re-reading. I'd really like to study her other books when I have the time and own them as this is the secret doctrine, the magical teaching on how the mind works.

I hope you get the opportunity to study this.

## About the author

**Name:** Gorkom, Nina Van 	**Role:** Author	

**International Standard Name Identifier (ISNI):** 0000 0000 6398 0326

**Biography**

Nina van Gorkom was born in 1928 to a family of socialist intellectuals. Her father was a member of the Dutch parliament. She studied at Leyden University and during this time she became a Catholic. In 1952, she married Lodewijk van Gorkom, a Dutch diplomat.

In 1965, Lodewijk was posted to Thailand and Nina started learning the Thai language. She took a keen interest in Buddhism, attending classes for foreigners at Wat Mahathat. There she met, in the summer of 1966, Sujin Boriharnwanaket. Impressed by the profundity of the Buddhist teachings, she became convinced of the truth of the Buddha’s words and later assisted Khun Sujin in discussions about Buddhism for Thai radio stations. These talks were later published as Buddhism in Daily Life, her first book.

Nina and Lodewijk left Thailand in 1970 and lived in Japan, New York, Indonesia (where Lodewijk was the Dutch ambassador) and Austria. Lodewijk retired in 1990 and she now lives in The Hague in Holland.

Nina’s writings are well-known amongst English speaking Buddhists, and she is highly respected in Thailand where several of her books have been translated into the Thai language with (after many reprints) over one hundred thousand copies now. Her books have also been translated in Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Nepal, China, Vietnam and Germany.
