## Introduction to the Buddhist Scriptures

**Author** Nina van Gorkom

**About**

An Introduction to the Buddhist scriptures with the aim to encourage the reader to study the texts themselves. In that way they can verify that the Buddha’s words were directed to the practice of what he taught, in particular to the development of right understanding of all phenomena of life. In the Appendix there is an enumeration of the texts of the Tipiṭaka and their commentaries with their translations into English. For the chapters many ideas were taken from lectures broadcast on a radio program in Thailand by Sujin Boriharnwanaket. She quotes extensively from all three parts of the scriptures, explains their meaning and inspires people to relate them to their daily life. If the texts are studied only with the purpose of intellectual understanding, we will fail to see the message they contain for our life at this moment and we do not understand the goal of the Buddha’s teachings.

It is a follow-up to Nina van Gorkom ’s book "The Buddha’s Path".

**Biography**

Nina van Gorkom was born in 1928 to a family of socialist intellectuals. Her father was a member of the Dutch parliament. She studied at Leyden University and during this time she became a Catholic. In 1952, she married Lodewijk van Gorkom, a Dutch diplomat.

In 1965, Lodewijk was posted to Thailand and Nina started learning the Thai language. She took a keen interest in Buddhism, attending classes for foreigners at Wat Mahathat. There she met, in the summer of 1966, Sujin Boriharnwanaket. Impressed by the profundity of the Buddhist teachings, she became convinced of the truth of the Buddha’s words and later assisted Khun Sujin in discussions about Buddhism for Thai radio stations. These talks were later published as Buddhism in Daily Life, her first book.

Nina and Lodewijk left Thailand in 1970 and lived in Japan, New York, Indonesia (where Lodewijk was the Dutch ambassador) and Austria. Lodewijk retired in 1990 and she now lives in The Hague in Holland.

Nina’s writings are well-known amongst English speaking Buddhists, and she is highly respected in Thailand where several of her books have been translated into the Thai language with (after many reprints) over one hundred thousand copies now. Her books have also been translated in Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Nepal, China, Vietnam and Germany.
